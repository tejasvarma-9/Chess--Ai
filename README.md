# Chess--Ai

A Chess AI that implements Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning to efficiently evaluate board positions and optimize move selection. It uses a heuristic evaluation function considering material advantage, center control, king safety, and mobility. The AI simulates possible moves, prunes unnecessary branches to improve performance, and selects the most strategic move for a competitive gameplay experience.
